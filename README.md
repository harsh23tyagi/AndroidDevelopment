# AndroidDevelopment
This repository contains minor android project that i feel people often look for and the layouts made by me will easily be molded according to the developer's choice.
 
 ## Concepts Used
 1. CardView inflated in holding the edittexts for username and password
 2. The main activity holds the card view and the logo
 3. Gradient.xml is created for the background gradient
